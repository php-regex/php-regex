CHANGELOG
=========

2.0
---

 * First release as its own package, split from `yoeunes/regex-parser`;
   see the [main changelog](https://github.com/php-regex/php-regex/blob/2.x/CHANGELOG.md).
 * The lookaround bodies of a pattern share one allowance: their states count
   together against `maxNfaStates` and `maxDfaStates`, and their work against
   one `maxTransitionsProcessed` budget, whose diagnostic names the
   `lookaround bodies` phase. A lookaround repeated by a quantifier is compiled
   once: `/(?:(?=a{99})){100}a{99}/` no longer builds a hundred automata.
 * `TrivialMatchClassifier::classify()` stops at 5,000 bytes, as
   `matchedLiteral()` does, while it combines the strings of a sequence: a
   pattern of twenty nested `(?:…){4}` around `a`, 4^20 bytes spelled out, no
   longer exhausts memory, and the answer is `null`.
