     * @param list<string>|null $values     every string the group can hold, or null when they are not a small finite set. An alternation that mixes enumerable and non-enumerable arms - (a|\d) - reads as null: the digits arm holds infinitely many strings, and the scalar facts below carry only what holds for every arm together; $arms keeps each arm
     * @param bool              $nonFalsy   every value is truthy: neither '' nor '0'
     * @param bool              $digitsOnly every value satisfies ctype_digit(): a non-empty run of ASCII 0-9
     * @param bool              $decimalInt every value satisfies (string) (int) $v === $v, PHPStan's decimal-int-string: '0', or up to 18 digits after an optional '-', the first of them not '0', so no '007', '-0', '+1' or value past PHP_INT_MAX
     * @param bool              $lowercase  every value satisfies strtolower($v) === $v, PHPStan's lowercase-string: no byte A-Z. strtolower() folds ASCII alone, so 'É' is lowercase too
     * @param bool              $uppercase  every value satisfies strtoupper($v) === $v, PHPStan's uppercase-string: no byte a-z. strtoupper() folds ASCII alone, so 'é' is uppercase too
     * @param list<self>        $arms       the shape of each way the group is set - each branch of the alternation it reads, each group of a branch reset bearing its number - when their join loses what they say: (a|\d) holds 'a' or digits. Empty when the facts above say it all. An arm bears the number, the name and the participation of the group
